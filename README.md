# CA2 — Cyber Attacks Analytics

[Online Demo](https://vast-2020.now.sh/)

The mini-challenge 1 of VAST Challenge 2020 asks participants to find the responsible white hat groups for a fictitious Internet outage. For the given task, we designed and developed a visual analytics system — CA2: Cyber Attacks Analytics — to comparing and matching subgraphs of a very lary graph of anonymized profiles. Furthermore, we demonstrate an iterative workflow to find the responsible group with the help of our system.
